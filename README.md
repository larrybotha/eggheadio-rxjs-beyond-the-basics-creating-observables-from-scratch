Learning and annotations from https://egghead.io/courses/rxjs-beyond-the-basics-creating-observables-from-scratch

1. Introduction

2. [Return multiple values from Observable in RxJS](./02/index.js)

    Takeaways:

    Observables differ from function calls primarily in their ability to emit
    multiple values, whereas a function can only ever return a single value when
    called.

    ```bash
    $ nodemon 02
    ```
